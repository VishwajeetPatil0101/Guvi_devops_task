here I have practiced some docker commands

docker ps: Lists running containers.
docker run: Creates and starts a new container from an image.

Managing Images:
docker pull: Downloads an image from a registry.

docker images: Lists all local images.

Docker network : 
  - docker network

Docker volume :
  - docker volume create
