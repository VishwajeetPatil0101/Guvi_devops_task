1. Go to AWS VPC Dashboard
  - Create VPC.
  - Choose CIDR - 10.0.0.0/16

2. Create Internet Gateway and associate it with Our VPC.

3. Create Route Table for Public Subnet.
  -Edit Route for all type IP and choose target As Internet gateway.
  - Choose subnet association and select Public Subnet.

4. Create Public Subnet with CIDR range 10.0.0.0/24 
5. Create Private subnet with CIDR range 10.0.1.0/24

6. Create Route Table for Private Subnet.
  - Do not edit Route
  - Choose subnet association and select Private Subnet.

7. Launch EC2 Instance in Our Created VPC and in Public Subnet.
