1. To perform this task we need ann AWS account through which we will create our EC2 instance
    we already have our AWS account

2. Install AWS CLI in our windows laptop

3. Install Terraform

4. Now we will Write Terraform Code in VS Code 
    1) Create provider.tf and main.tf to run the code

5. We need to connect our terraform to our AWS account, for that we need to run - AWS configure  command and we will enter our credentials to connect with AWS account 

6. Then Run below Terraform commands to run the code and create EC2 instances

    - terraform init
    - terraform validate
    - terraform plan
    - terraform apply

7. Now we have our EC2 instaces created

8. If you want to delete those instaces from terraform itself then run - terraform destroy
